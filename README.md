# Setting-Up-TS3-on-a-New-PC-in-2024

## Hello world!
I'm Jamjellybee :wave: Just wanted to document all the steps I took to set up The Sims 3 on my new PC in 2024!

## Getting Started
### The Game
* **The Sims 3 + all expansion packs**: I downloaded and installed this from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)

### For Mods
* **CC Magic**: Love this for organising custom content!

  * I found it kept closing on launch and realised I needed to download something called "XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0 Refresh driver" from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=27598) 
* **Sims 3 Package Editor (S3PE)**: I use this for inspecting + organising package files
  * [Link to S3PE download](https://www.nraas.net/community/S3PE) (I downloaded Windows Easy Installer version)
  * Requires Microsoft Framework .NET 4 - I downloaded .NET Framework 4.8.1 from this [link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net481) (Developer Pack)

### For Development
* **Visual Studio Code**: My favourite IDE

## PC Specs
Since The Sims 3 is a 11 year old game (2009-2013), it's often said that newer computers struggle to handle it. So incase it's helpful, I've added my PC specs below:
