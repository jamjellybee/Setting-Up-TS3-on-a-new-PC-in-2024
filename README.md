# Setting-Up-TS3-on-a-New-PC-in-2024

## Hello world!
I'm Jamjellybee :wave: Just wanted to document all the steps I took to set up The Sims 3 on my new PC in 2024!

## Getting Started
### The Game
* **The Sims 3 + all expansion packs**: I downloaded and installed this from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)

### For Mods
* **Mod Folder**: This is required to install mods
  * Instructions + download can be found in [this guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1131162350) under the "Installing The Mods Folder" chapter 
* **CC Magic**: Love this for organising custom content!
  * [Link to CC Magic download](https://modthesims.info/d/461888/cc-magic-custom-content-management-and-game-launcher-updated-07-15-2012-works-with-supernatural.html)
  * I found it kept closing on launch and realised I needed to download something called "XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0 Refresh driver" from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=27598) 
* **Sims 3 Package Editor (S3PE)**: I use this for inspecting + organising package files
  * [Link to S3PE download](https://www.nraas.net/community/S3PE) (I downloaded Windows Easy Installer version)
  * Requires Microsoft Framework .NET 4 - I downloaded .NET Framework 4.8.1 from this [link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net481) (Developer Pack)

### For Development
* **Visual Studio Code**: My favourite IDE
  * [Link to VS Code download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* **Git Bash for Windows**: My preferred terminal 
  * [Link to Git Bash download](https://gitforwindows.org/)
* **S3OC**: haven't used yet
  * [Link to S3OC download](https://www.nraas.net/community/S3PE) (I downloaded Windows Easy Installer version)

## My Game Settings
I mainly followed [The Sims 3 Performance & Bug Fix Guide 2024](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1131162350). 
* **The Sims 3 GPU Add-on Support Tool**: Apparently needed to recognise modern GPU drivers (although my game was able to still without)
  * [Link to The Sims 3 GPU Add-on Support Tool](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fthesims3%2Fmods%2F106)
  * I needed to register an account and then downloaded the executable file (.exe)

## PC Specs
Since The Sims 3 is a 11 year old game (2009-2013), it's often said that newer computers struggle to handle it. So incase it's helpful, I've added my PC specs below:
